<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>SPI slave driver implementation. The task is to create a driver controlling SPI hardware controller in slave mode,
		and to ensure optimal performance through the use of DMA and interrupt. Creating an easy to implement realization 
		of SPI slave would definitely help the BeagleBone community members to write applications based on SPI much more 
		easily. The first implementation of my protocol driver is going to example of a bidirectional data exchange. 
		This application will provide the BeagleBone community with valuable experience and will be a good example 
		of SPI slave. Hardware limitations make it impossible to perform any realization of the device using SPI slave. 
		Sending away data to the master during one transaction is not possible. One transaction is enough to receive data 
		by slave device. To receive and send back data, two transactions are needed. The data received from master device 
		in a single transaction is transferred to the user after completing the transaction. The user's reply to received 
		data is sent in the next transaction.</p>

<p>The framework in Linux should have 3 layers. In this way, there can be low level 
hardware interfaces to SPI hardware like McSPI in slave mode, a middle layer of common 
functions to call by protocol drivers, and then a top protocol driver layer which can be used to implement.

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>		
<h3>The main problems that don't allow us to create a fully universal generic SPI slave driver.</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The master device can begin the transaction at any time, even if the slave device isn't ready to receive data.</li>
	<li>The transfer can be of any length, as standard SPI does not specify the frame’s length. 
		Theoretically, the master device can send so much data that the slave device would stop receiving it because of memory overflow.</li>
	<li>SPI interface is a rather fast interface (10s or 100s of MHz), so with too fast clock the system can’t keep up with 
		generated interrupts. SPI slave controller will hammer the system with interrupts and the system might become unresponsive.</li>
	<li>Even if you manage to pass data to userspace during the transaction, user will have no 
		time to return the response that will be transferred to the master in the same transaction.</li>
	<li>When transaction is short but often repeated, slave device has no time to set the DMA transfer.</li>
	<li>The register with the contents of the data to be sent must be loaded by DMA before the transaction  
	(high state on cs line). There is no way to load a register of broadcasting prior to the transaction, 
	because you do not know the address of the data to come back before the transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The slave device, after installing the driver and DTS, will be ready to receive the data. 
		The user must set the SPI slave device before the master device.</li>
	<li>During the installation of the driver, the user must declare the maximum depth of data buffer. 
		The length is the same for tx and rx. Transfer may be shorter, but not longer than the declared length.</li>
	<li>The maximum speed of the slave mode specified in the documentation is 16Mhz as the maximum speed of SCLK line.</li>
	<li>Holding the response in memory and sending it in the next transaction solves the problem. 
		The time between the transactions is greater than between the reception and transmission during a single transaction.</li>
	<li>Two-stage transactions allow to use DMA for loading and unloading mcspi buffer.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="final-raport">Final raport</h2>
<p>The project’s initial version involved the creation of SPI driver in slave mode. The first implementation 
of realized framework was supposed to be SPI Flash Emulator. To ensure optimal performance, the 
driver was meant to use SPI controller, DMA and interrupt. </p>
  
<p>After contacting linux-spi and finding Marek Vašut, a developer who already had experience with 
SPI slave drivers, we had a constructive exchange of ideas. Marek introduced me to many
 critical elements. Michael noticed a limitation that made it impossible to create a fully generic 
slave driver. The project needed a thorough reconstruction.</p>

<p>The project consists of three layers. The first and the lowest layer supports the SPI hardware controller. 
McSPI controller is located in BeagleBone Black, and the driver was developed exactly to this controller. 
The whole implementation is located in spi-mcspi-slave.c[1] file. The controller easily handles small 
transfers to 32 bytes with clock to 24 MHz. It supports a variety of word lengths, from 4 bits to 32 bits per word. 
DMA was supposed to provide support for longer transfer lengths; however, I was not able to develop it 
before the end of GSoC. DMA support will be added after GSoC.</p>

<p>The second layer is responsible for communication between the lowest layer and userspace. This layer 
consists of a core (bus) which connects the device and driver. It is a bus and a set of functions registering 
and managing other SPI slave devices. It was implemented in files spi-slave-core.c [2] and spi-slave-core.h 
[3]. Framework uses device tree overlay. On the basis of DTB, it matches the device to the driver. I have
created two files dts for McSPI 0 slave.dts [4] and SPI1_slave.dts [5].</p>

<p>A simple user interface, allowing to carry out the transfer has been added in spi-slave-dev.c [6]
and spi-slave-dev.h[7] files. For each installed device, the driver provides file in userspace 
(/dev/spislave0 and /dev/spislave1). The driver has the usual fs operations and a number of IOCTL
functions (described in more detail in spi-slave-dev.h [7]), as well as POLL methods used to inform
about the end of transaction.</p>

<p>I have added a simple spislave_app.c [8] application, which is using SPI slave framework.
It is a good example on how to use SPI slave.</p>

<p>Documentation located on wiki page [9] and in the documentation directory [10] in repository 
describes the driver, clarifies and explains its limitations and shows the main problems 
because of which a fully generic spi driver in slave mode is difficult to obtain. It also 
provides information concerning work plan for each GSoC week. Moreover, it shows 
stage by stage how to compile, install and use the framework, as well as the way the 
master is connected to the slave on example of BeagleBoard Black.</p>

<h3>What did not work and why:</h3>
DMA is the only part of the project which -  despite being planned to be involved in the project’s 
final version  - was not successful. DMA was supposed to provide support for transactions larger
than 32 bytes. Support for DMA has been written, however, I could not merge it. This is the
element that I am going to add after GSoC, for it proved to be too difficult for such limited time.

<h3>What I have learned during GSoC:</h3>
<ul><li>upstream process and interaction with maintainers</li>
<li>how to create a variety of types of modules connected to the linux kernel</li>
<li>handling devices mapped in memory</li>
<li>creating a correct and visually aesthetic code compatible with the linux kernel coding style</li>
<li>planning and describing a project </li>
<li>how bus, device and driver work</li>
<li>character device drivers and fs operations in practice</li>
<li>methods for debugging and fault finding</li>
<li>better git use</li>
<li>and many more ;)</li></ul>

<h3>What's next:</h3>
Currently I am after third review of my code. Greg pointed to many mistakes and provided me with
valuable advices, so my code looks a lot better now. I learned a lot thanks to his help. 
As for upstream code for kernel, I am quite skeptical. It is difficult and my code does not necessarily 
correspond to the image of SPI slave preferred by linux-spi. Nevertheless, I still wish to continue work
on this code. We will see what happens.

<h3>A few words in conclusion:</h3>
The final report does not end my adventure with linux kernel and BeagleBoard community. These three 
months have shown me that writing elements of Linux is not quite that difficult. I have also met a great 
BeagleBoard community and I have got to know many wonderful people. I would like to thank Michael for
rescuing me when I got stuck and for such great amount of knowledge he shared with me. I’m especially 
thankful for Andrew for his support during the draft preparation. Many thanks to everyone who helped and 
supported me during GSoC. You are amazing.

<h3>The first option:</h3>
<p>One AM335x processor contains two McSPI controllers, 
what allows to use one controller as  slave and the 
other as  master. This allows to carry out tests on one board.</p>

<h3>The second option:</h3>
<p>The second option is to use two boards where one works as master and the other as slave.</p>
